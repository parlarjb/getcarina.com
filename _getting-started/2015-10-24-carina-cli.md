This tutorial demonstrates how to install and configure the Carina client so that you can use it to launch and control Docker Swarm clusters on a Carina endpoint. The `carina` command-line interface (CLI) is a self-contained binary written in Go, so installation involves downloading a binary, making it executable, adding it to your path, and then configuring it with credentials.

**Note**: This guide uses the command-line interface to create a cluster. To use the graphical user interface, see [Getting started on Carina]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/getting-started-on-carina/).

### Prerequisites

* A Carina account. If you do not already have one, create a free account (no credit card required) by following the [sign up process](https://app.getcarina.com/app/signup).

* Your Carina API key. To get it, go to the [Carina Control Panel](https://app.getcarina.com), click your username in the top-right corner, and then click **API Key**.

* The Docker client. Use the [Docker Version Manager (dvm)]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-version-manager/).

### Download and install the CLI

To download and install the `carina` CLI, use the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

#### OS X with Homebrew

If you're using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), run the following command:

```bash
$ brew install carina
```

#### Linux and OS X (without Homebrew)

Downloads for the latest release of `carina` are available in [releases](https://github.com/getcarina/carina/releases/latest) for 64-bit Linux and OS X. You can use `curl` to download the binary, move it to a directory on your `$PATH`, and make it executable:

```bash
$ curl -L https://download.getcarina.com/carina/latest/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/carina -o carina
$ mv carina ~/bin/carina
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/carina
```

#### Windows with Chocolatey

If you are using [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/), run the following command:

```powershell
> choco install carina
```

#### Windows (without Chocolatey)

Downloads for the latest release of `carina` are available in [releases](https://github.com/getcarina/carina/releases/latest). For quick installation, open PowerShell and run the following command:

```powershell
> wget 'https://download.getcarina.com/carina/latest/Windows/x86_64/carina.exe' -OutFile carina.exe
```

Be sure to move `carina.exe` to a directory on your `%PATH%`.

### Configure with Carina credentials

1. Gather the required information:
  * Username (CARINA_USERNAME): Your Carina username from the [Carina Control Panel](https://app.getcarina.com).
  * API key (CARINA_APIKEY): Your Carina API key. To find it, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

2. Set your environment variables to contain these credentials. For example:

    **Bash**

    ```bash
    $ export CARINA_USERNAME=fnamelname
    $ export CARINA_APIKEY=ddd1233abcdef4a0bc5da6789123ab45c
    ```

    **PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    > $env:CARINA_USERNAME="fnamelname"
    > $env:CARINA_APIKEY="ddd1233abcdef4a0bc5da6789123ab45c"
    ```

3. Verify that you can issue `carina` commands:

      ```bash
      $ carina list
      ```

      If you have some clusters already running, you see output similar to the following output:

      ```
      ClusterName       Flavor           Segments  AutoScale    Status
      websocketsrock    container1-2G    2         true         active
      railsanne         container1-4G    4         true         active
      ```

### Manage Carina clusters

1. Create a Carina cluster by using the `carina create` command. Replace `mycluster` with the name of your cluster.

    ```bash
    $ carina create mycluster --wait --segments=2 --autoscale

    mycluster    container1-4G    2    true    active

    Read more about the parameters below:
    * --wait       wait for swarm cluster completion
    * --segments=1    number of segments for the initial cluster
    * --autoscale  Turn autoscale on or off. Turning it on means that Carina automatically adds segments as they are needed.
    ```

2. After the cluster is created, download the credentials for the cluster. Replace `mycluster` with the name of your cluster.

    **Bash**

    ```bash
    $ carina credentials --path=/tmp/mycluster mycluster
    ```

    **PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    > carina credentials --path="$env:TMP\mycluster" mycluster
    ```

    `--path=PATH` indicates the local directory path to write the credentials files to.

3. Load your credentials. Replace `mycluster` with the name of your cluster.

    **Bash**

    ```bash
    $ source /tmp/mycluster/docker.env
    ```

    **PowerShell**

    ```powershell
    > Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Unrestricted
    > . "$env:TMP\mycluster\docker.ps1"
    ```

    See [Load a Docker environment from the command line on Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/load-docker-environment-on-windows/).

4. Use your credentials to interact with your cluster:

    ```bash
    $ docker info

    Containers: 6
    Images: 4
    Role: primary
    Strategy: spread
    Filters: affinity, health, constraint, port, dependency

5. View the Swarm management containers:

    ```bash
    $ docker ps -a
